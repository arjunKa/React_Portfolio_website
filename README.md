# Portfolio Site - Arjun Kaura
Link to site: [arjunkaura.com](https://arjunkaura.com/)

This is a repository for my latest Portfolio Website, built using React. It uses a clean and simple look while also having multiple nice-to-have features for easy user experience such as a reactive design which reponds to the screen dimensions, meaning that it is usable on mobile. This portfolio website evolves and grows constantly as I add more projects and features, so there will be much more to add.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
